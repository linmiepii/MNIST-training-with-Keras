# MNIST-training-with-Keras
my first deep learning exercise in my very start AI tour

use keras to do MNIST training exercise. I planed to do different parameter, like activation function , loss function, varient number neuron and hidden layers, to compare the accuracy. in last, visualizing accuracy, make it easy for compare the difference.
